Around 1958, there were close to 10,000 baby boys named Steve. There was a steady decline in the use of the name after that and still to the present day. Barbara was a very popular name for baby girls in the mid 1950s where close to 50,000 girls were given the name. Just like the name Steve for boys, the usage hit its peak and has been in a decline ever since.

### Distribution of Births By First Letter

The letter "A" seems to be the most popular first letter for girls, while the letter "J" is the most popular for boys.
